CAT is a Thing.

["CAT", Thing* aThing]
aThing = new Type["CAT"] ();   //Type name can be a variable, or equivalently ctor can be pointed by a function pointer.

Current solution:

aThing = makeAThingTable["CAT"];

makeAThingTable has a ["CAT", &makeACat()] pair.  MakeACat returns a pointer to a Cat.
